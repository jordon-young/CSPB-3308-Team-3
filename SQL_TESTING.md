## users table

__Table Name:__ users  
__Table Description:__ This table stores basic user data to assist with login/verfication and to pass to other pages to keep track of the user__  
__Fields:__
- id int(The primary key identifying the users table)
- first_name(This is so we can verify users and greet them on our page to make it more personal)
- last_name(This is so we can verify users and greet them on our page to make it more personal)

List of tests for verifying each table:
You must also provide the following (in SQL_TESTING.md)for each data access method (at least one access method for each table or query required to get the data to display):

__Method of Access:__ Users will be able to access the database to retrieve passwords, edit personal information and to login. Other application pages will access the database to personalize pages and provide accurate data.  
__Name:__ Login/Create Account/Reset Password  
__Description:__ These pages will take user input and either create an entry in the database or update an entry in the database.  
__Parameters:__ These pages will verify they arent overwriting data into another user, it will validate that each person provides a valid email address, it will validate each user has a unique user name and it will verify password strength.
__Return values:__ If done successfully the user will be able to login, reset their password, and edit their personal data.  Their data will also be used to personalize other pages in the app.
__List of tests for verifying each access method:__ Test create_db to ensure database is created and doesnt overwrite an existing database, also adds .db to end of file if user does not.  
Test add_user to ensure we are able to add users to the database without overwriting existing data, to include unique username.  
Test edit_user to ensure we are able to edit data without overwriting a different user, to include keeping a unique username.  
Test delete_user to assist administrators in deleting old accounts. Will verify that a user can be deleted without compromising the database.

## workouts

This table stores data related to specific workouts.

__Fields:__

List of tests for verifying each table:

__Method of Access:__ This DB will be appended to by a workout input page on a single form. In the form a user will select/add data to fields that will be submitted and added back to table. This table and DB data will be avaliable on the same page. The table data will not be editable, only support a "delete row" which will remove selected row data from the table & DB and then a user will have to again fill the form and re-submit to fix any mistakes. Within the form will have its own type selectors to ensure that the data fed into the db is a supported type.

__Name:__ workout_db_created, workout_remove

__Description:__ This page will take user input with already specified types and create entries into the DB. This page will also, upon user request remove db entries.(possibly edit single specified fields, without entire entry removal). 

__Pre-conditions:__ User fills in workout entry form.

__Test Steps:__ 
  1. Navigate to page
  2. Fill out form
  3. Submit Form
    - Repeat as needed for multiple workouts

__Expected Result:__ DB will be updated with provided information. Mulitple form submissions will be appended in the order recieved. 

__Actual Result:__ Table on page will be updated with infomation provided.

__List of tests for verifying each access method:__ 
- test_create to ensure database is created and doesnt overwrite an existing database, also adds .db to end of file if user does not. 
- test_append to ensure data is added to db without any overwriting.
- test_remove to ensure specific data is removed from db.

## User Food History table

__Table Name:__ user_food_history

__Table Description:__ This table will hold the reference data for user inputs in order to track user nutrient history

List of tests for verifying each table:

__Method of Access:__ Each time a user inputs a new food to the tracker, food db will be accessed and combined with input food amt to get nutrient data for this entry along with input time so the user can have a full history of the meals they've been tracking. This table can then be accessed in another page that shows user history. It can be accessed to show history and to perform data analysis on the users meal history to show trends in their eating habits. 

__Name:__ create_db, insert_input, access_history

__Description:__ signup page will create a new empty db so new user can track eating. Input page will allow users to input single meals which will then be appended to this db along with the date so that an accurate record of meal history can be kept. Tracking page will show the data from this db as well as graphs that analyze the users history.

__Pre-conditions:__ User has filled in at least two meals

__Test Steps:__ 
  1. Register new user
  2. Input two meals
  3. pull and show history db data on history page

__Expected Result:__ Empty db will be created for each new user. When user inputs new meals, that data will be appended to the data base.

__Actual Result:__ Visiting nutrient history page will pull up this db as well as graphs showing trends.

__List of tests for verifying each access method:__ 
- test_create to ensure new db is created upon new registration
- test_input to verify that food db is correctly referenced and input food data is pulled
- test_tracking to show nutrient data by input date
