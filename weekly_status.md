- Separate out CSS and JavaScript
- Write JavaScript for calculating calorie totals and creating new rows for each entry

### Will

##### Progress:

###### Database Design:
- Created an E/R (Entity-Relationship) diagram for the database schema that will serve as the foundation for our food lookup feature.
- The diagram helps to visualize the relationships and connections between various data entities that will be part of the database.

###### Documentation:
- Included a legend with the E/R diagram to ensure clarity in interpretation and understanding of the various symbols and relationships depicted.
- The diagram, along with its legend, has been stored in the `images/sprint_01` directory for reference.

### Dylan

Created user stories for nutrient/calory input page
Created "things to have" table based on user stories
- included input, output, input form type, what will this need columns
- "what will this need" column has loose ideas for what this will entail

### Eric

Create branch in repository for my feature (page).
Create rough outline for how an exercise input page will look
- What will this page output? (what are the most important items to show)
- Create testing to insure proper inputs
- plan time with Jordan to talk about how our pages will talk between each other, if that is still in our plans.
- 
### Jordon

- Brainstorm structure for storing workout, exercise, and sets information
- Collect list of machine weight lifting exercises

### Will

#### Food Lookup Feature

##### Progress:

###### Initial Setup & Integration with Flask:
- Successfully set up a Flask development framework for the Food Lookup Feature.
- Created a dedicated route for the food tracking page.

###### UI Design & Implementation:
- Designed a basic layout with an input field using `foodlookup.html`.
- Styled the page for a user-friendly experience.

###### Version Control:
- Created a `food_lookup` branch for feature-specific development.

###### Documentation:
- Documented the purpose and features of the `food_lookup.py` in code comments within the python file, to be referenced for later documentation.

##### Next Steps:

###### Set Up MySQL Connection with Flask:
- Establish a MySQL database for the project, which will store foods and their nutritional values.
- Connect the Flask app to this MySQL database using the Flask-MySQL extension.

###### Auto-populate to Relational Database:
- Implement functionality to detect user input in real-time in the food input field.
- Create backend logic to fetch matching food names based on user input and display them as suggestions.

##### Challenges/Blockers:
- The main challenge anticipated for the upcoming week is ensuring a smooth connection between Flask and MySQL, especially considering potential server and database configurations that might need adjustments.
- Constructing the database correctly that can/will be accessed by other team members will require good collaboration on the part of the team.
- Implementing the auto-populate feature requires synchronization between frontend and backend, ensuring efficient and relevant suggestions without overloading the database with frequent queries.


## Sprint 3: 2023-10-12 to 2023-10-19

### Billy - Created a Team3_flask_app.py file for webpage routing

Added a setup.cmds file to facilitate webpage viewing

Added a login development branch on git

### Dylan

Added macros inputs to cals input page
Worked on .js file to incorporate inputs into page table

#### Next Steps

Finish js file to move inputs and totals to page table
Have to develop database structure for maintaining history of user cal and macro inputs
- will include a button to add current page table as the input to the history


### Eric
###### Progress:
  Put together 1st draft of exercise input page, get basics implemented for input

###### Next Steps: 
  -create diagram/drawn interpretation of what I want the page to look like
  -figure out VScode hiccup that is preventing 
  -need to step back and create a better descriptions for page. Look to create 5 user stories to help narrow down exactly what features I want to implement.
  -set up basic layouts to pretty up page

### Jordon

#### Exercise Database Structure

![Exercise Database Structure](/images/weekly_status/sprint_03/exercise-database-diagram.png)

Most of the data is in the sets table. Which workout and exercise each set belongs to comes from those corresponding foreign keys.

#### Preliminary Exercise Log Wireframe

![Exercise Log Wireframe](/images/weekly_status/sprint_03/exercise-log-wireframe.png)

This is a very early design. The idea is to list the workouts and be able to show and hide them.

### Will

#### Food Lookup Feature

##### Progress: 

- Created sample database food_database.db using SQLite. Contains one table (foods) with nutrition values, and three sample food items (avocados, onions, and salami)
- Created a create_food_db.py file to create database, print tables and data for debugging, and fill with sample data
- Modified foodlookup.html to include javascript that will allow for auto-population of user input when they input into the foodlookup page
- Added a route in food_lookup.py for querying of the database to allow for auto-population on /foodlookup page

##### Next Steps: 

- Alter backend database to include a food log that stores food that users log that they have consumed, and references the foods table for the nutritional information
- Add functionality for users to input which foods they ate and how much they ate, and update the food log accordingly
- - Include different units of measurement for users to input when they add food. 
- Add functionality for users to input their own food items into the database if they want to input a food that is not in the database

##### Challenges: 

- This will be a lot to implement, and I may not be able to get it all done at once.
- I am not planning on implementing error handling/input validation yet, so I should be careful about testing these features when I create them.
- More frontend and javascript will be necessary, and again I am not well-versed in this area.
- I will have to make sure altering my database schema makes sense and does not cause problems with what I already have. 

- I will have to make sure altering my database schema makes sense and does not cause problems with what I already have. 

## Sprint 4: 2023-10-20 to 2023-10-26

### Billy - 
* Created routes and rendered pages using flask on port 3308. 

* Verified data input and rendered three pages Login/Creat_Account/Reset_Password.

* Completed Milestone 4 and updated the wireframe with actual screenshots.

* Worked on adding stylesheets to html to render a page.

* Next week will work on database creation, entries, and edits.

### Dylan

* Completed Milestone 4 and created wireframe of page

* Worked on implementing output table with a running increment of inputs for each macro

* next week will finish html so output table works and will work on SQL diagram and logic

### Eric
* created wireframe and narrowed down parameters for page.
* will be looking how to create a db to save inputs for specific users

### Jordon

![Exercise Log Diagram](/images/weekly_status/sprint_04/exercise-log-database.png)

Created a more formalized SQL database structure for the exercise lo.

### Will

##### Progress:

- Added inputs on the foodlookup page to allow users to add food items to the database if they can't find their desired food for lookup.
- Made necessary tweaks in the backend to accommodate the creation and addition of new food data.
- Made adjustments to the frontend HTML template to include these new inputs.
- Currently, the page has empty buttons and placeholders for user input.

##### Next Steps:

- Complete the functionality for users to add food items to the database via the foodlookup page.
- Implement more comprehensive input validation for users adding food items to ensure data integrity and user experience.
- Delve deeper into Javascript implementation for this feature, ensuring seamless frontend and backend integration.

##### Challenges:

- The main challenge lies in implementing the required Javascript functionality, as it's an area I'm still familiarizing myself with.
- Ensuring that the modifications to the database and frontend don't introduce any unforeseen issues or bugs.
- Striking a balance between user-friendliness and data integrity as users gain the ability to add their own food items.
